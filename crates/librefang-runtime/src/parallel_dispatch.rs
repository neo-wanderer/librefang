//! Batch tool-call planner for the agent loop's parallel dispatcher.
//!
//! Given the sequence of tool calls the LLM produced in one assistant turn,
//! [`plan_batch`] partitions them into ordered groups: calls within a group
//! may run concurrently, groups themselves run sequentially. The original
//! call ordering is preserved so the resulting `tool_result` blocks line up
//! with the assistant's `tool_use` blocks (a hard requirement on the
//! Anthropic Messages API and respected by every other provider).
//!
//! This module is currently **passive** — `plan_batch` is not called by the
//! agent loop yet. PR-4 / PR-5 will wire it into the non-streaming and
//! streaming dispatchers; PR-3 will gate it behind a config flag. See
//! `.plans/parallel-tool-calls.md` for the full series.
//!
//! # Algorithm summary
//! 1. Empty / single-call batch → trivial group(s).
//! 2. Any [`ParallelSafety::Exclusive`] call → every call gets its own
//!    one-element group (whole batch serialises).
//! 3. Greedy bucketing in original order: each call joins the first
//!    compatible existing bucket, or starts a new one. A bucket is
//!    compatible when it does not yet hold a `WriteShared` member and no
//!    `WriteScoped` member's target path overlaps the candidate's.
//!
//! Path overlap is component-aware ("/a/b/c" vs "/a/bc" do not overlap)
//! and lexical (`..` / `.` are folded without touching the filesystem,
//! since target files may not yet exist).
